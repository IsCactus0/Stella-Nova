WEAPONS
	Self-Forging Warhead
	# Secondary Projectile
		Creates a small explosion once projectile reaches 0 penetration.
		Fires a second molten copper projectile from this explosion.
		Increases the cost of all ammunition (e.g. Crafting ammunition now requires Tantalum).

		# Once projectile calls its OnDestroy() function,
		# Spawn a new copper warhead projectile at original projectiles position moving in same direction.

		Pyrophoric Metal
			Causes Incendiary Effects post detonation in area of explosion.
			Increases the cost of all ammunition further (e.g. Crafting ammunition now requires Magnesium).

			# Add effect to all

	Shockwave cannon
	# Shockwave
		Creates a small shockwave pushing all nearby objects away.
		

		# Shockwave now causes damage
			Increases the size of the shockwave, and damages objects
			in vicinity.
		# Shockwave now also disorients
			Disorients all nearby entities

ABILITIES
	
	# Increased Pickup Range
		Allows the player to attract nearby pickups from further away.

		# Increase players pickup range variable.

	Nano-Disassemblers
	# AOE Damage
		Causes all foreign objects (e.g. asteroids and enemies) to take passive "burn" damage when in a given vicinity.
		Possibly giving the player a small amount of resources for all objects completely destroyed by the nano-bots.

		# Find all objects in within set range
		# Loop over all found objects spawning particles randomly along their polygon.
		# When spawing the particle damage object by small amount (e.g. 1 - 7).
		# Particles move towards player with inverse square falloff.
		# Once particles reach player give player some components of the given objects drops.

	Optical-Displacement Drive
	# Invisibility
		Allows the player to become partially invisible shrinking the effective sight range of all enemies while shield is active.
		Can be upgraded to increase longevity and effectiveness.

		# Alter player visibility variable when ability is active.
		# Multiply Sight range of all enemies by player visibility variable.
		# Use shader to draw shield effects.
